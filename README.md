* For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install cmake ninja lib-wayland++ libgl1-mesa-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev libxkbcommon-dev rapidjson-dev`
* From the source root `mkdir build` and move into the directory.
* `cmake -G Ninja ../`. This should check you development environment for required packages, download the Flutter engine artifacts and unpack the same in the build directory.

Flutter Wayland Embedder
========================

Usage: `flutter_wayland <asset_bundle_path> <flutter_flags>`

This utility runs an instance of a Flutter application and renders using
Wayland core protocols.

The Flutter tools can be obtained at https://flutter.io/

asset_bundle_path: The Flutter application code needs to be snapshotted using
                   the Flutter tools and the assets packaged in the appropriate
                   location. This can be done for any Flutter application by
                   running `flutter build bundle` while in the directory of a
                   valid Flutter project. This should package all the code and
                   assets in the "build/flutter_assets" directory. Specify this
                   directory as the first argument to this utility.

    flutter_flags: Typically empty. These extra flags are passed directly to the
                   Flutter engine. To see all supported flags, run
                   `flutter_tester --help` using the test binary included in the
                   Flutter tools.
